TERMINATOR Lib is a custom Python library for Raspberry Pi
It uses gpiozero to create functions to control motors.
I wrote that code for a school project.
This code is intended to be used with 4 Motors and an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.
I will not maintain it at all, when it's finished, it's finished, but you can still fork it if you want...
